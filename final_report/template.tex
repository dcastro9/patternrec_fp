\section{CIOS (\"Extra Credit\")}
There were 25 questions in the CIOS survey :). In terms of feedback, I found the course to be very engaging because the class itself allowed for great discussions, and was very personable (it was easy to ask questions and discuss topics with fellow peers). Towards the end of the course the material did not flow as well so modifying that for future teachings of this course would be useful. Thanks a lot for everything, I thoroughly enjoyed the material and the projects we got to do throughout the semester.
